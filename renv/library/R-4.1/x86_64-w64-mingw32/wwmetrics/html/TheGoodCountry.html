<h2>The Good Country Index</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from The Good Country Index: &quot;The idea of the Good Country Index is simple: to measure what each country on earth contributes to the common good of humanity, and what it takes away, relative to its size. Using a wide range of data from the U.N. and other international organisations, we’ve given each country a balance-sheet to show at a glance whether it’s a net creditor to mankind, a burden on the planet, or something in between.&quot; (source: https://goodcountry.org/index/about-the-index)
