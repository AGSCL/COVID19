<h2>Measures of Within-Country Diversity (Religion and Language).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data on the measures of within-country diversity for 120 countries.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
data("Within_Country_Diversity")
</pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A tibble with 120 observations and 3 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li><p> Country. Factor indicating the country (ISO3 code).
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Religious_Diversity. Numeric. As reported in the article &quot;The Effects of Within-Country Linguistic and Religious Diversity on Foreign Acquisitions&quot; (JIBS, April 2016, v47-3: 319-346) two measures of within-country diversity were created using essentially the same data as was used to create the linguistic distance and religious distance scales (see [documentation on psychic distance stimuli]https://sites.google.com/site/ddowresearch/home/scales). For linguistic diversity, the indices are constructed such that a value of 1 represents the situation where no two individuals within the country speak the same language.  Conversely a value of 0 represents the situation where every individual within the country speaks the same language.

</li>
<li><p> Language_Diversity. Numeric. As reported in the article &quot;The Effects of Within-Country Linguistic and Religious Diversity on Foreign Acquisitions&quot; (JIBS, April 2016, v47-3: 319-346) two measures of within-country diversity were created using essentially the same data as was used to create the linguistic distance and religious distance scales (see [documentation on psychic distance stimuli]https://sites.google.com/site/ddowresearch/home/scales). For religious diversity, the indices are constructed such that a value of 1 represents the situation where no two individuals within the country adhere to the same religion.  Conversely a value of 0 represents the situation where every individual within the country adheres to the same religion.
